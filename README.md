# [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) working with [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) Sample Code

Part of a personal [list](https://github.com/audiBookning/sample-nestjs-codes) of random samples code for NestJS

- Just one App with No one service: a PostgreSQL DB.

- Do not forget to change `.qovery.example.yml` with the relevant data and rename it to `.qovery.yml`.

- The `.env.example` file should be renamed to `.env`.

- No tests are implemented yet.

## Disclaimer

This code is not and will never be maintained. It is just some random sample code.

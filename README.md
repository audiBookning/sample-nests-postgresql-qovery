# [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) working with [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) Sample Code

- Just one App with No one service: a PostgreSQL DB.

- Do not forget to change `.qovery.example.yml` with the relevant data and rename it to `.qovery.yml`.

- The `.env.example` file should be renamed to `.env`.

- No tests are implemented yet.
